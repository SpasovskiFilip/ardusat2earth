Space Apps Skopje - ArduSat Challenge 

As part of the NASA SpaceAppsChallenge, we decided to go with the ArduSat challenge. Our main goal is the ArduSat - Science Challenge, where we'll use both the on-board camera and the magnetometer to create a sun sensor and an Earth horizon sensor. 
In addition to the main goal, we have also taken another challenge upon us, and that is "The percentage of how green our planet is?" We'll scan the surface of the earth and determinate how many percents of it is green (forests, parks, valleys, etc. We want to call that the life sensor, and for that we're going to use the camera and th Spectruino sensor.

All that will be visible on a website witch is going to be updated more frequently (depending on the use of the ArduSat)
